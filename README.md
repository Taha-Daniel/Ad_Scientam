#Atom Counter

   Atom Counter is a package available on Python 3.7 which can count the occurrences of each atoms of a molecule. And it will print it on 
   your terminal. It takes as an argument a string representing a molecule and return a dictionary with each atoms as key
    and their number of occurrences in this formula. You can also download as a package and use it.
    Be careful the molecule must be right (parenthesis mistake or misspell)
   
    from atom_counter.counter import execute
    
    execute("CO2")
    
 
 ## Make a try directly 
 It will print the answer directly on ur terminal
 
    python main.py CO2
